        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">
            No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. 
        </p>
        <p class="description"> 
            The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. 
            If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. 
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes(or to taste)</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, 
                stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. 
                Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. 
                Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. 
                Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, 
                and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
            </li>
        </ol>
