    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        No oven is needed for this beef short rib recipe. Instead, your stovetop does double duty, 
        first in searing flour-dredged ribs, then in simmering them with vegetables and herbs in a savory mixture of wine and stock. 
    </p>
    <p>This dish is great served over mashed potatoes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds beef short ribs</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped onions</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped carrots</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>3 large bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine</li>
        <li>8 cups beef stock</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season ribs with salt and pepper, then dredge in flour.</li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Sear ribs in hot oil in small batches, 
            adding oil as needed, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add onions to the pot and sauté for 2 minutes. Add celery and carrots; sauté for 1 minute. 
            Season with salt and pepper, then stir in garlic, thyme, and bay leaves. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour wine into the pot and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a 
            wooden spoon. Add stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low; add ribs and simmer until meat pulls away easily 
            from the bone and sauce has thickened, about 2 hours. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Discard bay leaves. Stir in parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
